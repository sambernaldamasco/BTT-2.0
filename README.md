#### Live site:

#### API repository

---

## Built with:
* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
* React

---

## App functions:

* Simulates an invite-only sign up for admin users
* Admin users can edit stats from each skater signed up for tryouts
* Admin user can add new skaters
* Admin user can accept or decline skater to enter the team
* Admin can add new practices and take attendance

---

## Approach taken
I wanted to rebuild the unit 2 application with relational databases and better front-end rendering.

---

# Unsolved Problems
* I was unable to figure it out in Rails how to create a session and send a browser cookie to the frontend
* I wanted to be able to export the attendance list to CSV.
